As AI models, particularly large language models, become more capable and autonomous, their societal impact raises urgent questions regarding fairness, interpretability, alignment with human values, and regulatory governance. In this talk, I will introduce Societal AI — a multidisciplinary research agenda that examines the intersection of AI and societal well-being. By integrating insights from computer science, psychology, law, sociology, and philosophy, we identify ten critical research questions that address AI’s ethical, technical, and social implications. These challenges include ensuring AI safety and reliability, optimizing human-AI collaboration, evaluating AI’s cognitive and creative potential, and establishing robust regulatory frameworks. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, we aim to develop AI systems that are not only powerful but also aligned with societal values, fostering a future where AI serves as a trusted and beneficial partner to humanity.</p>"
